# CSGO-Config
This is a simple csgo config. I believe all the commands are working on the current build of CSGO. If you plan on using this make sure to change the provided crosshairs to your preference.

In my config jump is bound to mwheelup and mwheeldown. Delete the lines if you don't want that. Also Capslock toggles the grenade crosshair while pressed.
